Time-Series-Forecasting
This is the extension of time series analysis. I have picked one series from the analysis to do further forecasting on it. Various forecasting methods are applied and their accuracy is checked. I have then decided to choose the best of all forecasting method and have done the 14 days ahead forecast since the time-series I am delaing with is a daily time-series. The Rscript comprises of the complete R code which was used in finding the best forecasting model and later on forecasting using this same model.
Refer the report for the detailed process of forecasting model building and forecasting.
